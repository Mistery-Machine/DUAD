        <p class>Hi there! I'm Daniel Fonseca, the developer behind this application.

This tool was born as a personal project with a dual purpose: to solve a real problem and to demonstrate my passion for software development. Task management applications are often overly complex, which ultimately becomes a distraction. My goal was to apply the principles of clean code and user-centered design to create an intuitive, fast, and frictionless solution.

The philosophy of this app is clear: productivity through minimalism. Every line of code, every UI component, has been optimized to provide a smooth and distraction-free experience, allowing users to focus on their work without obstacles.</p></div>
